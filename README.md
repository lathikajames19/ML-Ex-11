### Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection
# AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

# Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs
Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook
# Algorithm

1.Start

2.Load the email dataset containing messages and labels (spam or ham).

3.Preprocess the dataset (e.g., convert labels to binary form).

4.Convert text messages into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.

5.Split the data into training and testing sets.

6.Create and train the SVM classifier using the training data.

7.Use the trained model to predict the labels on the test data.

8.Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification metrics.

9.Stop
